# **Core Features (Minimum Viable Product)**

For your first iteration, let's focus on the absolute essentials to get a basic social networking experience running.

* ## **User Authentication:**

  * **Goal:** Allow users to securely sign up, log in, and log out.  
  * **Technology:** Netlify Identity seems like an excellent choice for simplicity. It handles the backend for you, and you can integrate it with JavaScript on your frontend.  
  * **Plan:**  
    1. Set up Netlify for your project.  
    2. Enable the Identity feature in your Netlify site settings.  
    3. Use the Netlify Identity widget or its JavaScript API to implement signup, login, and logout functionality on your landing page.

* ## **Basic Profile Creation:**

  * **Goal:** Allow users to create a minimal profile with a username (which will be their identifier).  
  * **Technology:** Your chosen database (see next point).  
  * **Plan:**  
    1. Determine the essential profile information (for now, just a username is sufficient).  
    2. Design a simple form on the profile page to capture this information.  
    3. When a new user signs up via Netlify Identity, store their username in your chosen database, linking it to their Netlify user ID (if possible and useful).

* ## **Posting and Displaying Content (The "Feed"):**

  * **Goal:** Allow users to create simple text posts and see posts from all users on the main page.  
  * **Technology:** Your chosen database.  
  * **Plan:**  
    1. Design a simple text input field and a "Post" button on the main page.  
    2. When a user submits a post, store the post content, the timestamp, and the author's username in your database.  
    3. On page load (or periodically), fetch the latest posts from the database and display them in a chronological order on the main page.

# **ITechnology Stack Decisions (Iterative)**

Let's solidify your technology choices for this first iteration.

* ## **Frontend:**

  * **HTML:** For structuring your three pages (landing, main, profile).  
  * **Bootstrap:** Excellent for quick and responsive styling. Focus on using its grid system and basic components.  
  * **Plain JavaScript:** Perfect for handling user interactions, form submissions, and fetching/displaying data. Astro could be considered later if you want to explore server-side rendering or a component-based approach, but for simplicity, stick with plain JS initially.

* ## **Backend (Authentication):**

  * **Netlify Identity:** As discussed, this handles the user accounts without you needing to manage a backend server for authentication.

* ## **Database:**

  * **Initial Recommendation: JSON files.** For a truly simple start, especially for a proof of concept, you could store your data (user profiles and posts) in JSON files.  
    * **Pros:** Extremely easy to set up, no external server needed. You can read and write files using JavaScript's fetch API in conjunction with a serverless function (which Netlify can host easily)  
  * **Next Step (If JSON becomes limiting):** Consider a simple NoSQL database like **Supabase** or **Firebase**. 

# **Page Structure and Basic UI**

* ## **Landing Page (Login/Signup):**

  * Simple layout with clear sections for login and signup.  
  * Utilize Bootstrap's form components for ease of styling.  
  * Integrate with Netlify Identity for the authentication flow.

* ## **Main Page (Feed and News \- For now, just the feed):**

  * A section for users to type and submit new posts.  
  * A display area to show the latest posts from all users, ordered chronologically.  
  * Consider a very basic visual structure using Bootstrap's grid.

* ## **Profile Page (Setting Own Preferences \- For now, just displaying the username):**

  * Display the logged-in user's username.  
  * In future iterations, you can add options for more profile details or preferences.

# **Step-by-Step Roadmap**

1. ## **Setup and Authentication:**

   * Create a Netlify account and a new site.  
   * Enable Netlify Identity.  
   * Implement the login and signup forms on your landing page using Netlify Identity.  
   * Ensure users can successfully create accounts and log in.

2. ## **Basic Profile Storage (JSON Files \- Initial):**

   * Decide on the structure of your users.json file (e.g., mapping Netlify User IDs to usernames).  
   * Implement a serverless function (on Netlify) or client-side logic (with potential security considerations) to save a username when a new user signs up.  
   * On the profile page, fetch and display the logged-in user's username.

3. ## **Basic Post Storage and Display (JSON Files \- Initial):**

   * Decide on the structure of your posts.json file (e.g., an array of post objects with content, timestamp, and author).  
   * Implement functionality on the main page to:  
     * Capture user input for new posts.  
     * Use a serverless function (on Netlify) or client-side logic to append the new post to your posts.json file.  
     * Fetch and display the posts from posts.json on the main page, ordered by timestamp.

4. ## **Refinement and Iteration:**

   * Review your code and structure.  
   * Identify areas for improvement or simplification.  
   * Consider moving to a more robust database like Supabase or Firebase if JSON files become a bottleneck or if you need more advanced querying.  
   * Plan your next iteration based on what you've learned (e.g., adding the ability to follow users, like posts, etc.).

# **Things You Haven't Thought Of (Yet\!)**

* **Data Security (Even with JSON):** Be mindful of how you're handling data, even in a proof of concept. Avoid exposing sensitive information directly in client-side code if you move beyond local storage. Serverless functions help with this.  
* **Error Handling:** Implement basic error handling for network requests and form submissions.  
* **User Experience (UX):** While minimal, try to make the flow intuitive. Clear button labels and basic feedback are important.  
* **Scalability (For Future Consideration):** While not a priority now, think about how your chosen database and architecture might scale if this were a real product.  
* **Real-time Updates:** Currently, users will need to refresh the page to see new posts. Real-time features (like WebSockets) add complexity but enhance the experience. You can consider this in later iterations.  
* **Privacy Considerations:** Even in a minimal version, think about how data is stored and who can see it. This aligns with your core idea.
