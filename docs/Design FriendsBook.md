# **Planned Features:**

* **Landing Page (Login/Signup \- Not Shown):** This design doesn't show the landing page, but you'll likely have a simpler layout focused on the authentication forms.  
* **Main Page (Feed and News):** This is clearly the main page with the central feed displaying posts from users.  
  * **Post Creation:** The "Social Media Template v1.0" section at the top seems to be where users can write status updates or perhaps share other content. The "Status feeling blue" placeholder suggests a text input area. The "Post" button is also visible.  
  * **Feed Display:** The central column shows a series of posts from "John Doe" and "Jane Doe," mimicking the core feed functionality you described. Each post includes:  
    * User information (profile picture, name, timestamp).  
    * Text content.  
    * Potentially images.  
    * Basic interactions (Like, Comment).  
* **Profile Page (Setting Own Preferences \- Represented by "My Profile" on the left):** The left sidebar with the "My Profile" section suggests access to a user's own profile page. While the image doesn't show the content of the profile page itself, this is where users would manage their information and preferences in future iterations.

# **Key UI Elements and How to Approach Them with Your Tech Stack:**

* **Layout Structure (HTML & Bootstrap):**  
  * The main areas would be:  
    * A left sidebar for "My Profile" and navigation.  
    * A central column for the main feed.  
    * A right sidebar for "Upcoming Events" and "Friend Request."  
* **Post Structure (HTML & Bootstrap):**  
  * Each post in the feed can be a div styled with Bootstrap's card component or custom CSS.  
  * Inside each post, you'll have elements for the user's profile picture (an \<img\> tag), name, timestamp, post content (a \<p\> tag), and any images (an \<img\> tag within a container, potentially using Bootstrap's carousel for multiple images, though the example shows them side-by-side).  
  * The "Like" and "Comment" buttons can be simple \<button\> elements.  
* **User Input (HTML & JavaScript):**  
  * The "Status feeling blue" area will be a \<textarea\> or an \<input type="text"\> element.  
  * The "Post" button will trigger a JavaScript function to capture the text content and send it to your serverless function to be saved in the JSON file.  
* **Displaying Posts (HTML & JavaScript):**  
  * When the main page loads (or when new posts are added), your JavaScript code will fetch the post data from your JSON file (via a serverless function).  
  * You'll then dynamically create the HTML elements for each post (using document.createElement() and manipulating the DOM or using template literals for cleaner code) and append them to the feed area in your HTML.  
* **Profile Information (HTML & JavaScript):**  
  * The left sidebar's "My Profile" section will likely display the logged-in user's avatar (an \<img\> tag) and potentially their username or other basic information fetched from your user data (stored in your JSON files).  
* **Right Sidebar (HTML & Bootstrap):**  
  * The "Upcoming Events" and "Friend Request" sections can be structured using Bootstrap's components like cards or simple div elements with custom styling. The content within these sections will also be dynamically added using JavaScript based on any future features you implement.

# **Considerations and Next Steps:**

1. **Start with the Basic Layout:** Focus on structuring the main page with the three columns using Bootstrap's grid. Get the basic skeleton in place first.  
2. **Implement Post Creation:** Get the text input and "Post" button working. When a user clicks "Post," your JavaScript should:  
   * Get the text from the input field.  
   * Send this data (along with the current user's identifier) to a serverless function.  
   * The serverless function will then add this new post to your posts.json file (making sure to include a timestamp and the author).  
   * After successfully saving, you'll likely want to refresh the feed to display the new post.  
3. **Implement Feed Display:** When the main page loads, your JavaScript should:  
   * Fetch the data from your posts.json file (again, via a serverless function).  
   * Iterate through the retrieved posts and dynamically generate the HTML for each post to display it in the central column.  
4. **Style with Bootstrap (and potentially custom CSS):** Use Bootstrap's classes to style the layout, forms, buttons, and the general appearance of the posts. You might need to add some custom CSS for more specific styling.  
5. **Handle User Identification:** When a user posts, you'll need a way to associate that post with their username (which you'll get from Netlify Identity). You'll need to pass the user's identity information to your serverless function when saving a new post.
